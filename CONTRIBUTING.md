# Contributing

Want an issue to be dealt with? Want to try your own hand at improving this tool?
Perhaps you just want to leave a kudos? Firstly, thank you,
and you've come to the right place. But before you dive in, please familiarize
yourself with the ground rules first.

Please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other
method with me or any other owners of this repository before making a change.

We also have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/ktddaeng/AO3TweetBuilder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
so please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Support & Kudos

The issue tracker for this project is not for support questions. If you need
help figuring out how to use the page, do not put your questions in the issue
tracker, simply leave a comment in the comment section of the
[original AO3 work for this project](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22517134/chapters/53806336).
Same applies to regular comments (like thank you's). If you wish to leave kudos
here on this site, the GitHub equivalent is the star.

to have the console open (Press Ctrl + Shift + I to get the console) so we can
see what errors happened.

The Issue Tracker is also used for submitting suggestions for improvement or
correction of surface errors (i.e. spelling fixes). Once again, please be polite
and use appropriate labels before submitting.
