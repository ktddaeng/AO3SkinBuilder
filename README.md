# AO3 Tweet Builder

<img src="/images/interface1.png" alt="Screenshot of Tweet Builder"/>

A user friendly interface to help AO3 writers create fake social media posts using
work skins and some extra HTML. Its companion Tweet work skin was made to
help writers mimic social media experiences in their stories or preserve
fanfiction written on Twitter. No coding necessary.

By entering into a form, users can easily build HTML code that mimics social
media posts from Twitter, including embedded images, quoted tweets, and even polls.
